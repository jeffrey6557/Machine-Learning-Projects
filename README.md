# machine-learning-papers
Course projects from machine learning course 6.867 at MIT Fall 2016. Each project coauthored by me and teammate Siyuan Dong describes a well-known algorithm and tests various implementations on datasets (e.g. MNIST). 

(1) SVM Classifiers Implementated with Pegasos Algorithm and Quadratic Programming

(2) Fully-Connected Neural Net and Convolutional Neural Net
