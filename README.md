# Machine-Learning-Projects
Each machine learning project describes a well-known algorithm or a class of them, and hands-on Python implementations applied to curated and real-world datasets (e.g. stock market index, hand-written digits), using Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib libraries. 

(1) SVM Classifiers Implementated with Pegasos Algorithm and Quadratic Programming

(2) Fully-Connected Neural Net and Convolutional Neural Net

(3) Predicting the Direction of Daily Equity and Currency Index Movement using Neural Network
