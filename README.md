# Machine-Learning-Projects
Course projects from machine learning course 6.867 at MIT Fall 2016. Each project describes a well-known algorithm or a class of them, and hands-on Python implementations applied to real-world datasets, using Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib libraries. 

(1) SVM Classifiers Implementated with Pegasos Algorithm and Quadratic Programming

(2) Fully-Connected Neural Net and Convolutional Neural Net

(3) Predicting the Direction of Daily Equity and Currency Index Movement using Neural Network
