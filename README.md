# machine-learning-papers
Coursework from machine learning course 6.867 at MIT Fall 2016. Each paper coauthored by me and my teammate (Siyuan Dong) describes the ins and outs of a well-known algorithm, and implementation on real-world data. 

(1) SVM on binary classification

(2) Neural Net on multi-class predition
